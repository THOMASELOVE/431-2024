# Welcome! 

431 is the first part of a two-semester sequence (with 432) in applied statistics and data science taught by Professor Thomas Love in the [Department of Population and Quantitative Health Sciences](https://case.edu/medicine/pqhs/) at [Case Western Reserve University](https://case.edu/).

## This page is mostly complete, but still under construction.

We will post almost all class materials for 431 before the class begins on 2024-08-27. Most of what's here shouldn't change, but some things might. Missing things and dead links should be resolved over the next few days. If you have questions, contact Dr. Love at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`.

## Getting Started

Your first few steps in this course are to:

1. Register and enroll via the [CWRU Student Information System (SIS)](https://sis.case.edu/).
2. Take a look at this website. Of particular importance is the Getting Started section you're reading now, and the [Course Calendar](calendar.qmd), but a lot of other material is available now, and more will appear as we approach the first day of class next Tuesday August 27.
3. Obtain a copy of David Spiegelhalter's [The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541675703), originally published in 2020 and available at all major book retailers for less than \$20.
4. Visit <https://bit.ly/431-2024-welcome> to complete the Welcome to 431 Survey, which is "Lab 0" for the course, technically due Wednesday August 28 at Noon, but we'd love to see you get this done before we start the class. Note: You must log into Google **via CWRU** in order to access the Survey.
5. You'll need to get R and RStudio on a computer you can control (including installing regular updates to the software) for the semester. You may want to get started on this process now - and installation details are found on our 431 [Software page](software.qmd). 
6. I also suggest you get started reading the first few sections (particularly the Introduction and Sections 1-2) of the online book [R for Data Science, 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/).

## Everything will appear on this website

Materials that will appear here include:

-   information on [software](software.qmd), including installation instructions for R, RStudio, and the key R packages and data sets we'll use
