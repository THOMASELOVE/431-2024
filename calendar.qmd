# Course Calendar

::: {.callout-important}

## This page is mostly complete, but still under construction.

We will post almost all class materials for 431 before the class begins on 2024-08-27. Most of what's here shouldn't change, but some things might. Missing things and dead links should be resolved over the next few days. If you have questions, contact Dr. Love at `Thomas dot Love at case dot edu`.

:::

All class sessions will be held from 1:00 to 2:15 PM in Room E321-323 on the third floor of the Robbins building at CWRU's School of Medicine.

Readings come from:

- **Spiegelhalter**: David Spiegelhalter's [The Art of Statistics: How to Learn from Data](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Statistics-How-Learn-Data/dp/1541675703) originally published in 2020 and available at all major book retailers.
- **R4DS**: R for Data Science (2nd edition), found at <https://r4ds.hadley.nz/>.
