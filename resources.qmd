### Other R and Quarto references I recommend

- [R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd Edition](https://r-graphics.org/)
- [R for Data Science, 2nd Edition](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
  - Sections on Workflow: [scripts and projects](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts) and [getting help](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-help)
- Posit's [Cheat Sheets](https://posit.co/resources/cheatsheets/)
- Quarto [main page](https://quarto.org/), especially [Get Started for R Studio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html) and [Guide](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/https://quarto.org/docs/guide/)
  - Also worth looking at R for Data Science's chapters on [Quarto](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto) and on [Quarto formatting](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/quarto-formats).
- R Colors ([pdf](http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~tzheng/files/Rcolor.pdf))
- [Introduction to Regression Methods for Public Health Using R](https://bookdown.org/rwnahhas/RMPH/) by Ramzi W. Nahhas
- Rebecca Barter's [An introduction to Python for R Users](https://rebeccabarter.com/blog/2023-09-11-from_r_to_python) has been helpful to some people making that transition, or the opposite one. The RStudio IDE is a free and open-source IDE for Python, as well as R. You can write scripts, import modules, and interactively [use Python within the RStudio IDE.](https://posit.co/blog/three-ways-to-program-in-python-with-rstudio/)
